This project focuses on predicting heart disease risk through the analysis of patient health data. Here are the steps I followed:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Dataset: Used the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Data Cleaning: Managed missing values, removed duplicates, and handled outliers.
Feature Engineering: Selected important features and normalized the data.

Model Selection:
Algorithm: Chose Logistic Regression due to its simplicity and interpretability in binary classification tasks.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Training: Developed the logistic regression model on the processed dataset.
Evaluation: Assessed performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

Results: Achieved high performance across accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.
